I believe and follow of them since I was a child. As long as my intuition and heart was in aligned, I always, always follow them.</p><p>Of course with time, I learnt that it didn't mean it was going to be a good thing, nor even a bad thing. But it'd be a path that you needed to take in order to learn, or fail to learn, a lesson.</p><p>I have made so many great mistakes. I have hurt people deeply. I've been hurt by people deeply. I regret none of it. Some of them became my best friends. Some other, never came back. That's alright. I didn't mean to hurt them and I know they didn't mean to hurt me. That's just the way it is and I'm ok with the logic behind.</p><p>And evidently it is intertwined with my romantic way of being. Both are silly beliefs I won't deny that. I love that part of me, though. </p><p>I just hope one day she, whoever she is, if there is any, can beat my crazy by doing something crazy herself.</p><p>Thus then, I will tell her <em>thank you, I love you</em>.</p></div></div></article></main></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=12d8fcd46db8fdc7af6797ec26849875"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
