I felt so stupid and ignorant. I felt like I was an inmature kid who just hurt and was protecting his stupid ego. Yes, being hurt is valid but once you understand the context and/history of a person, you realize how unfair you are. </p><blockquote><p>Be Kind; Everyone You Meet is Fighting a Hard Battle</p></blockquote><figure class="post__video"><video loading="lazy" width="694" height="347" style="width: 694px; height: 347px;" controls="controls" data-mce-fragment="1"><source src="https://github.com/thelastinuit/thelastinuit.github.io/raw/videos/you%20have%20always%20been%20my%20better.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></figure><p>And I felt I betrayed myself. I go around saying that my first thought of a person is a good intention and yet here I am judging someone because I got hurt and making me myself believe all sort of things. I was just stupid and inmature. And now I have and want to forgive myself.</p><figure class="post__video"><video loading="lazy" width="694" height="347" style="width: 694px; height: 347px;" controls="controls" data-mce-fragment="1"><source src="https://github.com/thelastinuit/thelastinuit.github.io/raw/videos/becauseifinallyam.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></figure><p>Through out the years I have learnt to forgive myself and also equally important to forgive those who hurt me intentionally and unintentionally. Human beings are quite complex that trying to make a judgement is so unfair... I have failed in the past and now again but that's alright... I'm learning to live... I think... well, maybe I'm just living, the learning not so much.</p><p>I'm so grateful that, God, the Universe, you named, has sent such wonderful people in my life. I'll be forever there for them, to love them, to take care of them, to listen to them, and so... I'm not saying is bad to complain, one must validate its own feelings but once feelings are experienced, one has the obligation to put everything into perspective.</p><figure class="post__video"><video loading="lazy" width="692" height="346" style="width: 692px; height: 346px;" controls="controls" data-mce-fragment="1"><source src="https://github.com/thelastinuit/thelastinuit.github.io/raw/videos/specksoftime.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></figure><p>To those who have been, that are there for me: <em>of all the places I could be, why would I want to be here with you? Yes. It doesn't make sense. But maybe love doesn't need to make sense. We just need to live it and cherish those few specks of time where things automagically make sense. </em></p><p><em><strong>Love you all, deeply...</strong></em></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Even after all this time<br>The Sun never says to the Earth<br>"You owe me"<br>Look what happens with a love like that<br>It lights up the whole sky</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
