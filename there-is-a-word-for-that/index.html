I say I got dumped 'cuz she requested me not to look for her anymore. So I kept my promise and I moved on. Obviously it was heavy but I had to. I needed to move on with my life since I believe in love and I want to give that beside close friends and family.</p><p>It was quite a journey. There was a lot of baggage from both parts. Hers was quite deep but it didn't matter to me. I loved her as a whole, with all the goods and the bads. I was ready to keep going but as I mentioned before as was requested to leave her alone.</p><p>Moving on was hard. In fact, I think I didn't do it on my own. Friends helped me. I went to therapy and I got even an idea to deal with my not-feeling-at-home issue.</p><figure class="post__video"><video loading="lazy" width="692" height="346" style="width: 692px; height: 346px;" controls="controls" data-mce-fragment="1"><source src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thelastinuit/thelastinuit.github.io/videos/supportitsbetter.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></figure><p>One of the things I realized, looking back, was that I tent to be very supportive by nature even though the other person was super competitive. It didn't matter then and It doesn't matter now but I do believe being supportive is better no matter who, your partner, your friend, etc. Competitive is something that might work but it's a hard relationship that demands a lot of maturity from both parties... and that's hardly the case.</p><p>Putting my beaten heart broken together was a challenge. I needed to fix or rather learn how to cope with my childhood trauma. In the end, I managed to do it. It actually made me a better human being, I think. I now can say to a person's face I love you which it was quite hard even with my partner.</p><figure class="post__video"><video loading="lazy" width="696" height="348" style="width: 696px; height: 348px;" controls="controls" data-mce-fragment="1"><source src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thelastinuit/thelastinuit.github.io/videos/thereisawordforthat.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></figure><p>Part of the journey (although it started before my last relationship) was to accept and recognize I'm the kind of person who sacrifice for the one who loves even when that might mean you will end up destroying yourself. Don't get me wrong, I don't think there is anything heroic in it. It just mean... that's who I am and I love it and I'm in love with my way of being. is it good for humanity? I dunno.</p><figure class="post__video"><video loading="lazy" width="692" height="346" style="width: 692px; height: 346px;" controls="controls" data-mce-fragment="1"><source src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thelastinuit/thelastinuit.github.io/videos/thebestthingwedo.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></figure><p>And I know what most people would say about love and self-sacrifice... blah, blah, blah. This is the life I've chosen and this is the path I will follow. It doesn't need to make sense. Love makes no sense. And as I said before, I don't think it's something we only humans do. Love transcends the space time continuum, I, for one, believe.</p><figure class="post__video"><video loading="lazy" width="694" height="347" style="width: 694px; height: 347px;" controls="controls" data-mce-fragment="1"><source src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thelastinuit/thelastinuit.github.io/videos/transcends.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></figure></div></div></article></main></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=12d8fcd46db8fdc7af6797ec26849875"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
