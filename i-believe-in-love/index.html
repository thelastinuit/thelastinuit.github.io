But in my life on Earth, she is the first person I heard to say that. I also believe such thing but I kept it to myself because I've heard people critize other people about it and I got scared. I didn't want to be rejected. I was only a child.</p><p>After so many years, I can say it without feeling bad. Hearing her uttering those words vibed so deep in me that it broke me out of my self-constructed shell. After all, it was me who put me there not people's criticism.</p><p>Is such thing silly? I will assume it is but I rather live in believing such thing. I have dwelled in other philosophies and I just can't keep doing that. </p><p>When I was a child I was such a hopeless romantic and silly. My grandma understood that. She was my best friend. I saw Life with such awe and she did too.</p><p>Why did I let society to mold me? Anyway, it is over.</p><p>I believe in Love.</p></div></div></article></main></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=12d8fcd46db8fdc7af6797ec26849875"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
