But in my life on Earth, she is the first person I heard to say that. I also believe such thing but I kept it to myself because I've heard people critize other people about it and I got scared. I didn't want to be rejected. I was only a child.</p><p>After so many years, I can say it without feeling bad. Hearing her uttering those words vibed so deep in me that it broke me out of my self-constructed shell. After all, it was me who put me there not people's criticism.</p><p>Is such thing silly? I will assume it is but I rather live in believing such thing. I have dwelled in other philosophies and I just can't keep doing that. </p><p>When I was a child I was such a hopeless romantic and silly. My grandma understood that. She was my best friend. I saw Life with such awe and she did too.</p><p>Why did I let society to mold me? Anyway, it is over.</p><p>I believe in Love.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 23, 2023</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://blog.aloui.se/authors/thelastinuit/" rel="author">thelastinuit</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Even after all this time<br>The Sun never says to the Earth<br>"You owe me"<br>Look what happens with a love like that<br>It lights up the whole sky</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
