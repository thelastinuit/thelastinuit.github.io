I say I got dumped 'cuz she requested me not to look for her anymore. So I kept my promise and I moved on. Obviously it was heavy but I had to. I needed to move on with my life since I believe in love and I want to give that beside close friends and family.</p><p>It was quite a journey. There was a lot of baggage from both parts. Hers was quite deep but it didn't matter to me. I loved her as a whole, with all the goods and the bads. I was ready to keep going but as I mentioned before as was requested to leave her alone.</p><p>Moving on was hard. In fact, I think I didn't do it on my own. Friends helped me. I went to therapy and I got even an idea to deal with my not-feeling-at-home issue.</p><figure class="post__video"><video loading="lazy" width="692" height="346" style="width: 692px; height: 346px;" controls="controls" data-mce-fragment="1"><source src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thelastinuit/thelastinuit.github.io/videos/supportitsbetter.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></figure><p>One of the things, looking back, it's that I tent to be very supportive by nature even though the other person was super competitive. It didn't matter then and It doesn't matter now that I notice but I do believe being supportive is better no matter who your partner, your friend, etc. Competitive is something that might work but it's a hard relationship that demands a lot of maturity from both parties... and that's hardly the case.</p><p>Putting my beaten heart broken together was a challenge. I needed to fix or rather learn how to cope with my childhood trauma. In the end, I managed to do it. It actually made me a better human being, I think. I now can say to the person face I love you which it was quite hard even with my partner.</p><figure class="post__video"><video loading="lazy" width="696" height="348" style="width: 696px; height: 348px;" controls="controls" data-mce-fragment="1"><source src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thelastinuit/thelastinuit.github.io/videos/thereisawordforthat.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></figure><p>Part of the journey, but not necessarily part of it, was to accept and recognize I'm the kind of person who sacrifice for the one who loves even when that might mean you will end up destroying yourself. Don't get me wrong, I don't think there is anything heroic in it. It just mean... that's who I am and I love it and I'm in love with my way of being. is it good for humanity? I dunno but it's just the way it is.</p><figure class="post__video"><video loading="lazy" width="692" height="346" style="width: 692px; height: 346px;" controls="controls" data-mce-fragment="1"><source src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thelastinuit/thelastinuit.github.io/videos/thebestthingwedo.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></figure><p>And I know what most people say about love and self-sacrifice but I don't care. This is the life I chosen and this is the path I will follow. It doesn't need to make sense. Love makes no sense. And as I said before, I don't think it's something we only humans do. Love transcends the space time continuum, I, for one, believe.</p><figure class="post__video"><video loading="lazy" width="694" height="347" style="width: 694px; height: 347px;" controls="controls" data-mce-fragment="1"><source src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thelastinuit/thelastinuit.github.io/videos/transcends.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></figure></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Even after all this time<br>The Sun never says to the Earth<br>"You owe me"<br>Look what happens with a love like that<br>It lights up the whole sky</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
