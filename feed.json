I believe and follow of them since I was a child. As long as my intuition and heart was in aligned, I always, always follow them.</p>\n<p>Of course with time, I learnt that it didn't mean it was going to be a good thing, nor even a bad thing. But it'd be a path that you needed to take in order to learn, or fail to learn, a lesson.</p>\n<p>I have made so many great mistakes. I have hurt people deeply. I've been hurt by people deeply. I regret none of it. Some of them became my best friends. Some other, never came back. That's alright. I didn't mean to hurt them and I know they didn't mean to hurt me. That's just the way it is and I'm ok with the logic behind.</p>\n<p>And evidently it is intertwined with my romantic way of being. Both are silly beliefs I won't deny that. I love that part of me, though. </p>\n<p>I just hope one day she, whoever she is, if there is any, can beat my crazy by doing something crazy herself.</p>\n<p>Thus then, I will tell her <em>thank you, I love you</em>.</p>",

But in my life on Earth, she is the first person I heard to say that. I also believe such thing but I kept it to myself because I've heard people critize other people about it and I got scared. I didn't want to be rejected. I was only a child.</p>\n<p>After so many years, I can say it without feeling bad. Hearing her uttering those words vibed so deep in me that it broke me out of my self-constructed shell. After all, it was me who put me there not people's criticism.</p>\n<p>Is such thing silly? I will assume it is but I rather live in believing such thing. I have dwelled in other philosophies and I just can't keep doing that. </p>\n<p>When I was a child I was such a hopeless romantic and silly. My grandma understood that. She was my best friend. I saw Life with such awe and she did too.</p>\n<p>Why did I let society to mold me? Anyway, it is over.</p>\n<p>I believe in Love.</p>",
