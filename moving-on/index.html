I came to say goodbye. I'm moving to another country, another culture, another company. It's been years since I visited my hometown. A few weeks ago my father asked: "How do you manage to heal so much? It certainly didn't happen with our help." Today I can say that moving away from my hometown helped a lot.</p><p>My family, like any other I presume, has certain degree of dysfunctionality. Through the years I learnt it was a lot, a lot. When I left my hometown I thought it was because I went to study but perhaps deep down I needed to go away. Maybe it's destiny thing. I dunno.</p><p>The last few fays have been intense. Lots of trauma and such. I became the "therapist" of my family somehow. I ended up exhausted. </p><p>Now, I'm moving away. What hurts is not the blood family but the family that I chose. They are such great people. And yet I'm leaving for a few years. Maybe less, who knows how what the tide will bring.</p><p>I thought my feelings of abandoment where the reason for never feeling myself at home. But now I think it's only part of the truth.</p><p>To the new adventures to come!</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Even after all this time<br>The Sun never says to the Earth<br>"You owe me"<br>Look what happens with a love like that<br>It lights up the whole sky</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
