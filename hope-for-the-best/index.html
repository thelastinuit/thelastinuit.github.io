Today more than ever in my life, this is what I need. Not only in terms of my surroundings and also in terms of my relationships.</p><p>I must confess for the past few months the uncertainty was the cause of my anxiety. I knew it. I knew that was the reason I walked 28km daily for 6 days straight without any desire to stop because I was low on energy. I wasn't. I think it's called anxiety disorder. In my case, it means all my anxiety is converted into energy, excessive loads of it. </p><p>After each walk, I wanted more but I forced myself to stop. I mean 28km non-stop for a fast walker? That's just insane. The veins in my legs looked like they were about to explode. It was just not nice at all to do that my body. But I noticed it and I stopped.</p><p>So, what now? Certainly the current global situation doesn't help at all. Will this ever stop?</p><blockquote><p>Don't believe in the myth of "one day when everything willl be different." Do what you love to do, what you are waiting to do, what you've been born to do, now.</p></blockquote><p>I guess after all these years, I just stop believing in that <em>everything will eventually get better</em>. It's one of those beliefs you wanted to be true. But I have to outgrow myself now. Gotta be a better man for me and my community.</p><p>Still let's hope for the best but I have no intention in believing it will end some day.</p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Even after all this time<br>The Sun never says to the Earth<br>"You owe me"<br>Look what happens with a love like that<br>It lights up the whole sky</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
