And the Void in itself is everything. And that have been enough to deal with this.</p><p><strong>Isolation: </strong>I remember that sometimes I feel so isolated because no one can understand me. I'm sure everyone has felt this one way. It is terrifying to think that no one can understand you even perhaps how one can make senses of oneself? In a recent trip I did with mushrooms I felt how my consciouness was disappearing or desintegrated. I was saying "I can't go back, I can't go back". I tried for a few hours to get back but It couldn't. Surprisingly I was not afraid but I understood, I think, what it feels to have a spread out consciousness.</p><p><strong>Freedom: </strong>This is one of the things that baffles me. We want freedom but at some one level we cannot be authentic. But in other layers, we do not want that, I think. Freedom is in a way the opposite of what the brain do: to find patterns in the chaos. If we have no groundness (freedom), we cannot make sense of anything and hence the fear or terror of things, of existence. I think I have managed this one good. I don't want freedom but I want the illusion of freedom perhaps even just a few options.</p><p><strong>Death: </strong>and finally this one. I think I've been dealing with this since I was a child. It has been tough but I think I have managed so far. In fact, I have come to the conclusion that I'm more afraid of eternity than death.</p><p><em>So, what to do with the time was given to us?</em></p><blockquote><p>So do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. <strong>All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us</strong>. </p><p>- Gandalf</p></blockquote><p> </p></div></div></article></main></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=12d8fcd46db8fdc7af6797ec26849875"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
