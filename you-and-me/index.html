That is not because I enjoy it but because the nature of my upbringing. You see, I am a poorly-made human being. I cannot speak about others, maybe everyone is. But I see other people well adjusted and makes me wonder. What's wrong with me?</p><p>Why do I feel too much that simple words of rejection tear apart my little wasted hearth? Why do I feel lonely even though I'm surrounded by people who clearly love me for who I am? Why do I always find a way to run away from things that bring me joy? Why do I enjoy suffering? Is it because I deserve it? Is this just my burden that I cannot share with anyone? How do couples are made and persist? I have failed so hard in my life and I thought I knew why. I have asked for forgiveness for my stupidity and my issues. I have forgave myself for always believing it is all my fault. I did have a piece of the cake but I always blame myself for everything like I don't deserve anything.</p><p>I do sacrifice myself for others in hopes of being accepted, loved and cared for. I think I always be regardless of the reason. This is my way of living. However, I will no longer run away. I will confront my fear of abandonment and rejection which is symbolically speaking to confront my death.</p><p>I am so sorry for all the pain I have caused you. After all the pain and suffering, you persisted, you have always had me. I think it's time for me to show you the same.</p><p><em>'Cuz God only knows what I'd be without you...</em></p><p>I love you,</p><p>you and me.</p></div></div></article></main></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=12d8fcd46db8fdc7af6797ec26849875"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
