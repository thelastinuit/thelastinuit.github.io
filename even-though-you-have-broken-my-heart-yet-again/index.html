I have no idea. But I do believe the following, so let me tell you a story.</p><p>I'm weak. I'm quite sensitive even a small word of rejection makes my heart and body feel hurt. Perhaps that's why my father was so hard on me. He knew the world would eat me alive. At my age, however, I do disagree with that strategy but I understand and forgive him for the verbal abuse he did. </p><p>I went through most of my life with this personae. The male that people expect me to be. I guess everybody does. <em>Why do we do this to ourselves?</em></p><p>But the truth is I'm tired. Probably you are too. I'm tired of not being me. I'm tired of dancing around avoiding being rejected. I'm tired. I'm tired. The whole point of this blog is precisely to expose myself. To be vulnerable. To be abused if that what people want to do. I'm tired. That's also why now I'm exposing myself through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thelastinuit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">audio</a>. <em>Why do we do this to ourselves?</em> There is so much pain and suffering already. <em>Why do we keep having wars? I don't understand what's going on most of the time</em>.</p><p>Anyway... I think there are so many ways to go through life. Is it really one better than the other one? <strong>Yes, just be kind to each other</strong>. I'm sure it will work out for you.</p><p>Mine is to believe there is such thing as <strong>unconditional love</strong>. When two people care and support each other without expecting anything in return regardless of your success, physical appearance, money, and so on. That's what I called <em>unconditional love</em>.</p><p>And I think those are the true relationships. The long lasting relationships we all want to have. <em>Hell</em>, Life will be hard. <em>God</em>, even harder than you think, but it doesn't matter the ups and downs of life, those relationships will be there for you, <em>always</em>. It doesn't matter the distance or time. <a href="https://blog.aloui.se/there-is-a-word-for-that/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One may say love transcends space and time</a>. Relationships like that are not subjected to <strong>anything</strong>, the value of the relationship is the relationship <strong>itself</strong>.</p><p>I'm so grateful for the people I have in my life, especially those women I love so much. They have supported me and care for me through through thick and thin even though I did almost fail them. But I guess I needed to live that in order to reinforce my beliefs.</p><p>This is for you, you know who you are. </p><p><em>And I will forever love you guys unconditionally through out space and time.</em></p><figure class="post__video"><video loading="lazy" width="694" height="347" style="width: 694px; height: 347px;" controls="controls" data-mce-fragment="1"><source src="https://github.com/thelastinuit/thelastinuit.github.io/raw/videos/taxeswithya.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></figure></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Even after all this time<br>The Sun never says to the Earth<br>"You owe me"<br>Look what happens with a love like that<br>It lights up the whole sky</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
