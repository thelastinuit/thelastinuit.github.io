Meaning, <em>you are not commited to something unless you're willing to sacrifice for it.</em></p><p>In recent days, I've been tested. A lot. So it made me wonder. Am I actually committed to it?</p><p>I know I almost failed before. In my defense I was totally devastated by the current relationship. But after that, my system of beliefs, which I think it gives my life meaning, got reinforced a good time. I think it was necessary to be a stronger male. </p><p>But, now I wonder If I'm actually committed to it. I'm in this position where the facts of the events are more important to preserve than the perception of each party. That's the most valuable thing to me... So I wonder... to what degree I need to let that go? Would that be enough to called a sacrifice? Am I doing any good to the other party by sacrificing what I value the most? This is been in my head for a few days already.</p><p>This cloud of images, numbers and words. I try to make sense of it and it doesn't come through. I was asked <em>how do I feel. </em>Honestly, I dunno. I'm trying to make sense of it and I'm very confused since I don't understand that cloud of stuff.</p><p>It's still there. I'm asking myself should I continue with this? My heart and mind says yes but that cloud in my head.. what does that mean?</p><p>I'm fine. I'm connected with my body. My feelings are fine. But I'm curious about that cloud. </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Even after all this time<br>The Sun never says to the Earth<br>"You owe me"<br>Look what happens with a love like that<br>It lights up the whole sky</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
