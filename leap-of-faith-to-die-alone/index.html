Primarily because I don't think a short video will explain what's going on inside myself. But as you migh expected because everything I am is everything I believe in.</p><p>Is there a possible way to find an objective reality? After everything is going around Earth... is it possible to have a leap of faith in believing everything's going to be fine?</p><p>One of the stories I have but not writing is <strong>Drill.</strong> The story is about an drill expert mainly on terrorist attacks. He lives in New York city. He moves around like any other human being. And eventually he starts noticing the so called signs. He keeps that to himself until and FBI agent approaches him. He is briefed about a coming attack and the goverment of United States want him to prepare the city.</p><p>Along his way he meets people in the area of astrology, spiritism and so. He goes deep into the art of mysticism.</p><p>And finally, in the end, he cannot save the city. It is when he release that the reality he thinks he knows is true... it's an illusion. </p><p>The story ends with him in a spaceship flying around in the void. There is nothing left but him plugged into a machine.</p><p>We are here asking for some other species to come and save us from ourselves...</p><p>Is anybody out there?</p><p>Perhaps we need to embrace the possible future: we are going to kill ourselves and we are going to die alone.</p></div></div></article></main></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=12d8fcd46db8fdc7af6797ec26849875"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
