Usually, they are just being themselves. But from our point of view, they are threatening an image that we have of them, or they are failing to meet an unspoken need of our own.</p></blockquote><p>One of my biggest fails, I've been told, is that I run away from conflict. I've tried to tell that's not the case but usually that happens in a heat moment and novody is listening. It's precisely because of that that I go away: <em>to calm down</em>.</p><p>But every time I tried that, I got pulled back. I did successfully go away but at the cost of being the bad one. Over the years I felt terrible about it because my chip is to, one, take the blame, and two, put other before me. Those are my problems and I do not put that load on people. However, perhaps I should. </p><p>Lately, I did not run and I did raise my voice, I did make decision in anger. I did not mean to hurt but, again, that's why we should not make decisions in such states.</p><p>I know that I don't like be in situations where I'm angry because the aforementioned but also because I grow watching my parents do that. It was awful. I grew up with such negativity now I see. </p><p>My family asked me why I left... I think they are right. I went away because I didn't want to live around that kind of environment. It did help, I believe.</p><p>Today I learnt more about negativity. I learnt how I have been negative towards others. Also learnt that if you go to have zero negativity in your life, which can be done, you will have the best relationships in life.</p><p>From <strong>Harville</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>Helen:</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Self-Reflect:</strong> <em>Keep in mind that the goal is not to repress the feelings behind our negative thoughts and behaviors—that would only add to our store of pent-up emotions—but rather to bring them out into the open and see them for what they really are: a warning sign that some aspect of the relationship needs work.</em><br><br><strong>Move from “You messages” to “I messages”:</strong> <em>When we are frustrated, it’s easy to move into negativity with “you messages” (you always, you never, you are such an &amp;#%!@?!) To help us move away from disparaging language (that provokes a reaction), we teach couples to use “I messages” (“I feel…,” “I experience…”) This helps you take responsibility for your feelings and also help your partner “hear” the frustration rather than move into a defensive stance.</em><br><br><strong>Assess Your Relationship:</strong> <em>Keep in mind that the pledge is to keep your relationship free of negativity. You will be assessing your relationship, not each other. In addition, what matters is if one partner experienced negativity from the other – regardless of whether that was the intention.</em></p></blockquote></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Even after all this time<br>The Sun never says to the Earth<br>"You owe me"<br>Look what happens with a love like that<br>It lights up the whole sky</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
