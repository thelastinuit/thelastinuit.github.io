I think it makes things easier for me. I can control if I can fix something or at least to try to fix something.</p><p>Not only reality is very complicate (<em>how do we even understand the sense of being? Do we though?</em>), we have different languages and communication barriers. Everyone has its own understanding of words. We all have our own perceptions of events and yet all of them are in a sense real. <em>I don't understand what's going on most of the time.</em></p><p>I spent most my life trying to decode human behaviour. I have read quite a few books in psychology, neurology and languages. None of them I have prepared for what living right now. <em>And I don't want to fail her... I love her very much</em>.</p><p>I must recognize that I have no much experience in romantic relationships. Perhaps that's part of the problem. But I made the decision since I was very young that I will always continue to fight to make a relationship work unless either two things happen:</p><ol><li>She says I have to leave her alone.</li><li>I see that me staying causes more troubles than going away.</li></ol><p>Which in turned did not provide much experience.</p><p>Human behavior is very interesting. I made peace that I will never understand it but I've gotta keep trying especially when it comes to her.</p><p>It hurts a lot to see her crying. Of course, I take the blame, it's my nature. Somehow, it feels like it's all my fault. And I just want to be a force of good to her, to care of her, to support her, to be for her and yet it feels I'm failing again and again.</p><p>I just hope that neither of those options happen but if it does, I know it will be for the best for her.</p><p>Me? Well, I'll probably be not ok but I have a few plans that they will keep me busy.</p><p>I can't blame no one but myself.</p><p>You know who you are. I promise I will be there for you and to try to be better for you every day unless, of course, you desire otherways.</p><p><em>Ich liebe dich so sehr... </em>😔</p></div></div></article></main></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=12d8fcd46db8fdc7af6797ec26849875"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
