Life is finite and fragile, and just because something is there one day, it might not be the next. Never take that for granted.<br><br>Say what you need to say, then say a little more.<br>Say too much. Show too much. Love too much.<br><br>Everything is temporary but love.<br>Love outlives us all.</p><p><strong>R.Q.</strong></p></blockquote><p>One of the things that one hear in the spiritual community is to find yourself, to know who you truly are. Know thyself, they say. Through the eyes of others, I have found myself. </p><p>That little kid who finds love in everything, who feels everything, who feels too much perhaps. It was me but along the way of growing as human being in this civilization somehow I lost it. But throughout the years I have also been recovering pieces of me.</p><p>I used to fall in love deeply. I used to feel a lot. My parents even tried to take to some psicologists. I cannot recall what they say but it didn't help. Perhaps they knew I was just a sensitive kid.</p><p>My father seeing that (and missing some other tragic stuff), and naive as he was, he went raw to the point of being me verbally abused. He wanted me to be tough. Life's hard so he got worried. Didn't help.</p><p>One thing I recently thanked him was that he knew he was hard on me. Every time, at night, one I was sleeping, he would be next time asking me for forgiveness.</p><p>I have no idea how I came to be the way I am. Maybe it was meant to be but some many things happened to me that it is a miracle I'm not dead or a complete asshole.</p><p>I'm so lucky.</p><p>So, let me expose myself and say the following. I do believe that love is something we don't understand yet. I wanted to believe so many years to be just a chemical reaction in the brain but I was wrong and deep downd I knew it.</p><p>I believe in love. </p><p>I believe it can transform the collection consciousness for the better.</p><p>I have no idea how but I must find the way even when it's impossible.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on September 24, 2023</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://blog.aloui.se/authors/thelastinuit/" rel="author">thelastinuit</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://blog.aloui.se/my-own.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> My Own</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Even after all this time<br>The Sun never says to the Earth<br>"You owe me"<br>Look what happens with a love like that<br>It lights up the whole sky</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
