People have questioned that before as you are stupid or at the very least naive. I disagree.</p><p>You know, I think I'm stronger enough to take a hit. I'm not naive enough to know that everyone can hurt you. Of course I know. I'm aware. I was not born yesterday. But you see, that's ok. I think everyone has their own journey. Maybe that was not the time for us to start a friendship or relationship. You hurt me and that's ok. I don't blame you at all. But I do have so little time on this planet that I cannot invest more time with ya. I wish ya the best and no hard feelings.</p><p>I believe in long lasting relationships. I think we all do. I think to put your faith on someone knowing they can hurt ya is courageus. You know that things can go sideways intentionally or unintentionally. That's alright. I do think this is the best strategy to move around in our society. We are not in the jungle anymore... well, maybe we are but I think this is better than any alternative.</p><p>I practice this in my daily life. I believe it and I live it. This is the way I am and the leader I want to be for my community, my civilization. This is what I owe to myself. This is after all my journey.</p><p>Believe in human beings specially nowadays.</p><p>Give it a try.</p><p>You may get surprised.</p><p>Now more than ever, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfQ9rGwYriQ">we need the Jedi</a>.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Even after all this time<br>The Sun never says to the Earth<br>"You owe me"<br>Look what happens with a love like that<br>It lights up the whole sky</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
