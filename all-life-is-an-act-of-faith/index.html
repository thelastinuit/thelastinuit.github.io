You see, for all life is an act of faith and an act of gamble... The moment that you enter into any kind of human undertaking in relationship, what an act of faith. See, you've given yourself up. But this is the most powerful thing that can be done: surrender. See. And love is an act of surrender to another person. Total abandonment. I give myself to you. Take me. Do anything you like with me. See. So, that's quite mad because you see, it's letting things get out of control... So, actually, therefore, the course of wisdom, what is really sensible, is to let go, is to commit oneself, to give oneself up and that's quite mad. So we come to the strange conclusion that in madness lies sanity.</p></blockquote><p>There are games you must play all in or you are not playing. Life, for starters, is one of them. You either live or not. The same goes with commitment. </p><p>There are some commitments you are either all in or not. Marriage, I believe, is one of them. I did not believe that before to be honest. But with age, I learnt I was totally wrong and naive.</p><p>It is hard, though. You don't know yourself. Ever. How can you expect to know someone else? Let alone marry her o him? How? Well, just like Life, Love and Marriage is an act of faith. You go all in knowing that it's going to be hard. And you probably are very wrong in your estimation, way wrong. It will be harder than you think.</p><p>But you see, that's the idea. You can grow. You can grow together. You will hate each other even if you're deeply in love and married. That's ok. </p><p>It's not about the <strong>journey</strong> nor the <strong>destination.</strong></p><p>It is about the company. With whom you are willing to go? Knowing that she or he will fail. Knowing that she or he will hurt you. Knowing that the road ahead is hell. With whom you are willing to go into the unknown?</p><p>Those are difficult questions to answer. It is not easy by any stretch of the imagination.</p><p>However, the right person, I believe, is out there. If you are lucky, you will find that person.</p><p>Me... well, I know that person. I'm lucky. Very lucky. <em>God</em> has been very <em>gracious</em>. And I'm quite grateful. I dunno if she's willing to jump but I can only say:</p><p><em>Will you marry me?</em></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExbGtxb3JnY3VheHF6bXp5dnBucTN5aWVhMGF1c3Vvd3RwZjRpczY1biZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/aZ4sQUpybai5y/giphy.gif" alt="" width="462" height="250" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><em>and hope for the best </em>🥹</p></div></div></article></main></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=12d8fcd46db8fdc7af6797ec26849875"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
