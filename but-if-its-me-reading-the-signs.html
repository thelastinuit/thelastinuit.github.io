I believe and follow of them since I was a child. As long as my intuition and heart was in aligned, I always, always follow them.</p><p>Of course with time, I learnt that it didn't mean it was going to be a good thing, nor even a bad thing. But it'd be a path that you needed to take in order to learn, or fail to learn, a lesson.</p><p>I have made so many great mistakes. I have hurt people deeply. I've been hurt by people deeply. I regret none of it. Some of them became my best friends. Some other, never came back. That's alright. I didn't mean to hurt them and I know they didn't mean to hurt me. That's just the way it is and I'm ok with the logic behind.</p><p>And evidently it is intertwined with my romantic way of being. Both are silly beliefs I won't deny that. I love that part of me, though. </p><p>I just hope one day she, whoever she is, if there is any, can beat my crazy by doing something crazy herself.</p><p>Thus then, I will tell her <em>thank you, I love you</em>.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 25, 2023</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://blog.aloui.se/authors/thelastinuit/" rel="author">thelastinuit</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://blog.aloui.se/i-believe-in-love.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> I Believe In Love</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Even after all this time<br>The Sun never says to the Earth<br>"You owe me"<br>Look what happens with a love like that<br>It lights up the whole sky</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
