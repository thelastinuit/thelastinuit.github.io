This does not necessarily make them real, except for the fact that you believe they are. Your beliefs create and dictate what your attitudes are. Your attitudes create and dictate how you respond—in other words, they dictate your feelings. And your feelings largely determine how you behave.</p></blockquote><p>It is hard to be yourself. The possibility of rejection is so daunting that we create persona around. We use them to navigate society and in doing so we cannot know ourselves through the eyes of the other since we are not truly ourselves.</p><figure class="post__video"><video loading="lazy" width="692" height="346" style="width: 692px; height: 346px;" controls="controls" data-mce-fragment="1"><source src="https://github.com/thelastinuit/thelastinuit.github.io/raw/videos/thereisawordforthat.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></figure><p>One of my hardcore beliefs is I believe in love. I believe love is a force that transcends space and time. I dunno why. I just know it. I just feel it. So, <em>if you’re looking for the word that means caring about someone beyond all rationality and wanting them to have everything they want no matter how much it destroys you, it’s <strong>love</strong>. And when you <strong>love</strong> someone you <strong>don’t</strong> stop, <strong>ever</strong>. Even when people roll their eyes, and call you <strong>crazy</strong>. Even then. <strong>Especially</strong> then.</em></p><p>And I love her very much beyond all rationality. My heart fills with joy every time I see her. I very much enjoy to please her, to threat her like a queen. I'm not saying she's <strong>perfect</strong>. What I'm saying is that she is indeed perfect <strong>for me </strong>in<strong> </strong><em>all aspects</em><strong>.</strong></p><p>I love her smile. I love the way she talks. I love the way she laughs. I love her beauty and the way she moves her body. I love the way she tastes and the way she shows her pleasure. I love the way she hugs me. I love how open she is and how vulnerable sometimes she tries not to be. I love how messy she is. I love seeing her choosing between her conflicts. I'm in love with her mind and how it baffles me. I love how erratic she is. I love how childish she is sometimes. I look at her past partners and I wonder why they didn't see that. Maybe they did. All I know if that I didn't know I was waiting for her and now that I know I'm so happy she is finally here.</p><p>Do I regret not going to Tokyo to see If I have a chance with her? <strong>Fuck</strong> no.</p><blockquote><p>Surrender isn't about being passive. It's about being open.<br>Danielle LaPorte</p></blockquote><p>Do I regret not going to Nürnberg to surrender to her? <strong>NO. AT. ALL.</strong></p><p>I have made a lot of mistakes in my life. <strong><em>A LOT</em></strong>. But choosing her every single time it was, it has been, it is and, God as my witness, it shall be the <strong>right</strong> decision.</p><p>How long with this last? I have no idea. I'm praying for a lifetime. I shall be so dogdamned lucky if I die in her arms.</p><p>Camus was right. Existence is pain but I can't barely agree with him now that I know she is real.</p><p>So, yeah, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Sil4oi_P0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how long will love you? As long as stars are above you... And longer if I can.</a></p><figure class="post__video"><video loading="lazy" width="692" height="346" style="width: 692px; height: 346px;" controls="controls" data-mce-fragment="1"><source src="https://github.com/thelastinuit/thelastinuit.github.io/raw/videos/cynical.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></figure><p><strong>PS:</strong> <em>I remember day I saw her for the first time. It was April the 20th. The first time I looked at her I couldn't looked into her eyes that long. The energy was so intense I needed to look away. And I have to confess: I asked God for help. Not only help was provided but I met such a wonderful person. Sometimes I wonder if she's real or am I dreaming. If so, I pray to never wake up. ever. <strong>God is gracious</strong>, very, very gracious.</em></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Even after all this time<br>The Sun never says to the Earth<br>"You owe me"<br>Look what happens with a love like that<br>It lights up the whole sky</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
