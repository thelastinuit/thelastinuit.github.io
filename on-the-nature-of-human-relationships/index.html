However, at the heart of these relationships, one key factor, the only factor, I, for one, believe is: <em>our childhood traumas</em>. The emotional wounds we carry from our early years significantly, <em>if not all</em>, affect how we interact with others, shaping our ability to trust, communicate, and form close bonds. Here I explore how childhood traumas impact our relationships, looking at how these early experiences influence our behavior and connections throughout our lives. </p><p>We are familiar with to know thyself it is only possible through the eyes of the other. Another way to see it is we project ourselves into others in order to explore our true nature without causing us any harm. Add, if you will, that we are looking for a sense of security which is threatened by our sense of authenticity. What a paradox!</p><p>Now the role of our care taker(s), is to give us that, a sense of security. And in us doing so we expose ourselves and our true nature which is often rejected. All these, I believe, is the core of how in the future we seek relationships not only romantic ones but all of them.</p><p>I have had my takes on that. I have suffered and I have hurted people. All that led me to believe we are kids just having kids. we are kids dealing with other kids. And yet, we stop being kids long time ago. I don't buy anymore this saying that there are adults in this world. It's a nice lie but lie nonetheless. Of course, there are people more awared of their traumas but it so easy to see how we fight, how we argue and all you can see it's a hurt kid who have needs that are not being met.</p><p>I've learnt I need to validate people's emotions even though the facts does not match those emotions. I've learnt that one must first listen then speak if any. I've learnt that most people just want to be heard. Do you know how much it takes to know if you will get along with someone? <em>One look. Just. One. Look.</em> </p><p>I don't have so many relationships, though. So what the heck do I know about them? But I can only say, next time you see yourself fighting with your partner, please stop. Hug him/her. Breath in. Breath out. Don't take life too seriously, it all will end soon, anyway. Enjoy the ride and let the bygones be bygones. </p></div></div></article></main></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=12d8fcd46db8fdc7af6797ec26849875"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
