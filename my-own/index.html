Each of us comes for a short visit, not knowing why, yet sometimes seeming to a divine purpose. From the standpoint of daily life, however, there is one thing we do know: <strong>that we are here for the sake of others.</strong></p><p>A.E.</p></blockquote><p>Those who knows me, knows me deeply, would say: <em>yeah, he is batshit crazy... but, you know, somehow, he does make sense regardless of how crazy it sounds</em>. They are talking about how I see reality, the human experience, love and other subjects. Indeed, If I try to be objective about myself, I would say the same thing to me: <em>what the fork are you talking about?</em></p><p>Nonetheless, I can tell you from the bottom of my heart that I mean it, I feel it, my intuition is guiding me and my heart talks and I follow. Always. Contrary to what people expect from such claims, that does not mean what I get it's going to be something good. Neither it's going to be something bad. But it always will be something that you need to experience it.</p><p>It is funny, though. I don't think reality is what we perceive. We hardly see the whole thing. And yet... why I feel so sure about my claims? I cannot reason with ya on that. I will tell you for you own good, call me crazy. I don't listen to me. This is crazy.</p><p>Long time ago I came to the conclusion, or rather my belief, that reality is relation. A relation between more than two things. You can called <em>Trinity</em>, if you will. From that, other conclusions started to appear in my head and from that... I have arrived to today.</p><p>I have no idea how we came to the conclusion what we don't need each other. But I'm not here to change that nor to go against it. I'm here to live what I preach: <em>I will hold your heart more tenderly than my own.</em></p><p class="msg msg--highlight"><em>To be is to be perceived, and so to know thyself is only possible through the eyes of the other. The nature of our immortal lives is in the consequences of our words and deeds, that go on and are pushing themselves throughout all time.</em><br><em>Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others, past and present, and by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future.</em></p><p> </p></div></div></article></main></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=12d8fcd46db8fdc7af6797ec26849875"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
