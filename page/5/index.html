Wield power to do good.</em></li><li><em>Real strength lies in domestication of one's emotions: not in pretending they don't exist.</em></li><li><em>Educate yourself.</em></li><li><em>Courage and humility</em></li></ol><h2>My values</h2><ol><li><em>Honor others </em>No matter what degree, title or lack of it, everyone has something to offer. It takes a village to raise a child. We all have a role to fulfill.</li><li><em>Empower others </em>Things are hard and complex. We all are doomed to make mistakes. Making room for mistakes allow us to grow.</li><li><em>Privilege people </em>Existence is pain and this system we have created only make things harder. Remember we are flying away on a gigant rock. Don't get dragged away by irrelevant things like profit, titles, ego, etc.</li><li><em>Serve with humility </em>We all have room for improvement, recognize it. Listen to others' feedback and be open to criticism.</li></ol><h2>Things I believe</h2><ol><li><em>How can I help? </em>I think the only way to be the best leader is by being of service to others.</li><li><em>I will hold your heart more tenderly than my own. </em>I will. For some reason I think I can take all the pain in the Cosmos.</li><li><em>The less forgivable the act, the more must be forgiven. The less loveable the person is, the more you must find the means to love them. </em>I have learnt that the hard way but I believe I must follow such principle.</li><li><em>I think everyone has something to offer and they are always open to do that. </em>The problem is there are so many things affecting us that we tend to be mean to each other, however, this means I believe humans have a good heart.</li><li><em>Any one has the capacity to become awesome at something. </em>The reasons why people look for expertise, in the end I believe, has nothing to do with the actual matter. I'd rather collaborate with someone up for a challange than with some expert on the matter.</li><li><em>We need one another. </em>Anyone can do things on its own... Perhaps not everything. However, I believe doing things together makes the experience more fun.</li><li><em>You are going to fail. </em>And so will I. That's the way it is and I'm fine with the logic behind. Do fail. By all means, do it.</li><li><em>I'm an open book. I trust you by default. </em>And if you decide to break that trust, that's alright. You will save me some time. I'm all about creating long lasting friendships and time is of the essence.</li><li><em>There are social conventions, social cues and sugar coding. I don't understand any of them. </em>Just be straight with me. I won't get offended. Otherwise, there will be misunderstanding. I guarantee that.</li></ol><h2>My flaws through time</h2><ol><li><em>I enjoy people in very, very short amounts of time: </em>I get bored. It's not people's fault but rather that I'm poorly made. After a few decades on the planet I finally know why. The reason why I can't be too much around people is because I'm happy. And when I'm happy my baggage, my childhood traumas, push me away as a defense mechanism. I don't want to lose that happiness. I don't want to lose that people in my life. This is quite sad since I cannot fix that. I can only cope with it.</li><li><em>I'm way too idealistic: </em>I find impossible things very appealing so I aim to that.</li><li><em>I hate myself: </em>Most of the time my stupidity doesn't pay off so...</li><li><em>I tend to be the stand up guy: </em>but I think it's because deep down I want to be the hero. Because heroes get to be loved and accepted. And, as I have discovered, I was rejected since early childhood and in so I have no place where I feel at home.</li><li><em>I'm not sure about anything: </em>I blame my training in physics.</li><li><em>I'm very pessimistic: </em>My pessimism is the fuel of my optimism.</li><li><em>I get bored a lot: </em>This most likely is a brain issue. A brain issue what was fixed at early stage of childhood.</li><li><em>I need to be busy: </em>I used to believe it was an existential reason but now I know it's because my childhood trauma.</li><li><em>I care how I dress: </em>Well, I do. I enjoy fashion as art.</li><li><em>I care how I look: </em>When you are not handsome, all you have is artificial aesthetics.</li></ol></div></div></article></main></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=12d8fcd46db8fdc7af6797ec26849875"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
