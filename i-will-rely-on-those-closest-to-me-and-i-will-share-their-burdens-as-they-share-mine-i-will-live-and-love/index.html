I was in my head and therefore not paying attention to the rest of me: body and emotions.</p><p>I asked myself even if I was right about something why do I care? What's the point on trying to keep everything as close to the truth/reality as possible? I'm not saying it's fine if we lie, nor If it's alright if others lie but rather that it's hard to know what's objectively true. And in trying to get closer to that... we lose ourselves... whatever that is.</p><p>So, </p><blockquote><p>I'm steady, calm. I slept well, no bad dreams. I am active and engaged. I'm aware of my surroundings and those in my immediate sphere. I'm attentive. I am focused on the essentials, to the exclusion of all else. I'm unsure of the future but I'm not concerned. I will rely on those closest to me, and I will share their burdens, as they share mine. I will live and love.</p></blockquote><p> </p></div></div></article></main></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=12d8fcd46db8fdc7af6797ec26849875"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
