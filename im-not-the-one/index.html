And naturally, I took all the blame and it was my fault.</p><p>In retrospective, I thought I could handle those projects but I guess I was desperated for money. It was a diff time and now it is not like that or at least not emotionally. Once I started evaluating each project I released that they need a better person than me. So, Ain't strange when it comes to admit I'm not the right person but this time it hurt my pride/ego but I needed to that, both projects are quite amazing and as I said I was not the right person.</p><p>In the end, the experience I think it was something that humbled me and also to remember that I cannot do everything and I cannot make happy everyone... sad but true.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Even after all this time<br>The Sun never says to the Earth<br>"You owe me"<br>Look what happens with a love like that<br>It lights up the whole sky</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
