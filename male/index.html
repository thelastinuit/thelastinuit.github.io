I collect questions and soft opinions. I'm not married to any opinion of mine. I try to understand stuff and in the end I follow my belief system even when it does not match with reality. So, for the first time, I will make a strong opinion: A male, a true male, is here <em><strong>to protect and serve</strong></em>.</p><p>In terms of biology, a male is the hunter, the provider, the protector. I like to believe that's the same in terms of, hmm, spiritual energy. In order to be the best leader, serving others is the only way.</p><p>Along the same topic, being part of the community involves your sacrifice. There is no community without sacrifice. Thus, a male in community by definition and nature, is the one who protect and serves its community.</p><p>Now, who would be a better leader? I believe now that the best leader is the one who didn't have any love. The one who was rejected. The one who was abandoned. The one who has such a shadow, the hardest one, I think. Those who were there but conquered their shadow, are the best leader. Where are they? One place, I think, is <em>orphan houses. </em></p><p>If they can conquer their shadows, I believe, they will be the best leaders. It is not an easy job for sure but I think it's worth trying.</p></div></div></article></main></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=12d8fcd46db8fdc7af6797ec26849875"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
