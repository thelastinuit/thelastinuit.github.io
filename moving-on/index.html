I came to say goodbye. I'm moving to another country, another culture, another company. It's been years since I visited my hometown. A few weeks ago my father asked: "How do you manage to heal so much? It certainly didn't happen with our help." Today I can say that moving away from my hometown helped a lot.</p><p>My family, like any other I presume, has certain degree of dysfunctionality. Through the years I learnt it was a lot, a lot. When I left my hometown I thought it was because I went to study but perhaps deep down I needed to go away. Maybe it's destiny thing. I dunno.</p><p>The last few fays have been intense. Lots of trauma and such. I became the "therapist" of my family somehow. I ended up exhausted. </p><p>Now, I'm moving away. What hurts is not the blood family but the family that I chose. They are such great people. And yet I'm leaving for a few years. Maybe less, who knows how what the tide will bring.</p><p>I thought my feelings of abandoment where the reason for never feeling myself at home. But now I think it's only part of the truth.</p><p>To the new adventures to come!</p></div></div></article></main></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=12d8fcd46db8fdc7af6797ec26849875"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
