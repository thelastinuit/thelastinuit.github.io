But unless they understand the unconscious desires that motivated their dysfunctional behavior in the first relationship and learn how to satisfy those desires with the new partner, the second relationship is destined to run aground on the same submerged rocks.</p></blockquote><p>It's funny how I keep having the same issues over and over. In different ways and flavors. But it is the same core issue. <strong>Rejection</strong> <em>&amp;</em> <strong>abandoment</strong>. Trying to find what I did not have when I was just a babe or child powerless to get the security I needed.</p><p>But, but, in recent events, I believe, I have conquered (not removed nor cured) the rejection and abandoment. Even better, I managed to keep calm and be of help to a dear friend of mine. I'm getting better for sure. Knowing me, I know I will get better but I also know... this is a forever journey with no end. That's alright, you know? Especially when you are surrounded by people who are there to support you.</p><p>To those who has been there for me, I thank you very much.</p><p><strong>PS:</strong> <em>Recently I said goodbye to my family... jeez.. how did I manage to grow? I have no idea. Probably because my friends were there for me. Yeah, certainly that.</em></p></div></div></article></main></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=12d8fcd46db8fdc7af6797ec26849875"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
