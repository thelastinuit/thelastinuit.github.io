It also took me 39 years to wanted to be a father. There was a lot to fix in me or rather learn to cope with but I have finally arrived. For things I cannot go at length right now, I asked for help and it was provided. She came right into my life I just didn't know how deep that would be.</p><p>First, how I became a man. I'm the kind of guy who has rejection/abandonment issues. I was bullied by the kids at my neighborhood. My father wanted me to be tough since his first born was too sensitive so he verbally abused me. I cannot blame him, though. Who knows how to be a father especially at the age of 17 years old, huh? And if you believe in stress or trauma pass on from mother to child, my mother also have rejection/abandonment issues from her mother and his partner. Anywho, the point is I needed to learn to cope with a lot of things. <br>To make matter more complicated, I didn't have many romantic partners and I didn't go to therapy. I did however was very analytical and didn't matter to me to go deep into my issues.<br>With help of ayahuasca, mushrooms and analysing my patterns, I took care of my issues. I thought It was ready until I had like a final boss. My second partner tore apart my heart so I needed to put it back together. I do not blame her at all by the way. She also had stuff to work on. I just hope my presence in her journey helped her to overcome some issues.<br>While I was getting over the breakup or trying to, I asked for help. It was too much. Months have passed and it was still in pain. Part of the recovery involved to fix more stuff on me. By the end of that journey, I became a man or rather the right manifestation of masculine energy. Based on what I have read, that was part of my new desire of become a father. The whole matter is a bit long to explain but you get the gist.</p><p>Now the part of asking for help. The same year I was becoming a man, I was also merging two part of me. The spiritual/mystical part and the scientist in me. You see. Part of me since I was a kid believe in many things. Things that I'm sure most people will consider them crazy. My other part was the scientist. The rational, evidence-based lifestyle. Why I have those two lives? I dunno. I think I wanted to explore everything without being judged plus I'm a hopeless romantic.<br>I have quite a few crazy, unbelievable stories but for now, let me say the following. There is a reality beyond what we perceive. And whether you want to believe it or not, you can ask for help. That help may be provided. How can you make it successful? I have no idea. All I can tell is that it was provided. The help you get might be good or bad. One thing is for sure: you need it in order to grow.</p><p>And finally, <em>Lebenslangerschicksalsschatz. </em>If you are lucky, you will meet all kind of people in your life that will help you grow. And one day, if you are lucky, you will meet someone. That someone will make you feel an instant connection. I can't tell you exactly how it is but I'm sure you will know what I mean. You just have to live it.<br>By the way, one look can tell you a lot about people. So, the first time I saw her. My whole body vibrated. It was so intense I couldn't hold the look on her eye for more than 1 second. At the moment I didn't know what was it. But in time, like the saying goes, you don't get to choose whom you love. I felt in love. Deeply in love.<br>But like I said... the Universe will provide you with stuff... but it doesn't mean they are good or bad... they will help you to grow.<br>Frankly, I feel in my heart, body, mind and spirit she is my <em>lebenslangerschicksalsschatz </em>but only time will tell if she will stay...</p><p>To love, the universal force that binds everything</p><p> </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 8, 2023</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://blog.aloui.se/authors/thelastinuit/" rel="author">thelastinuit</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Even after all this time<br>The Sun never says to the Earth<br>"You owe me"<br>Look what happens with a love like that<br>It lights up the whole sky</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://blog.aloui.se/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
